# Port_Scanner_Examples
Example Code used to script a port scanner five different ways (Bash, Powershell, Ruby, Python, Perl)

This repository contains basic scripts to scan an ip and port to determine if it is open. This was done primarily as a project to learn a bit about how this is done in the various scripting languages. I have written the same script in Python, Bash, Powershell, Ruby, and Perl. I am posting this because it was more difficult than I thought it should be to find resouces on creating these scripts, and I hope that this will help someone coming along behind me.
